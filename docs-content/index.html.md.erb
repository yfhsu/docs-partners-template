This documentation describes the Vormetric Transparent Encryption (VTE) for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). The Vormetric
Transparent Encryption for PCF tile works in conjunction with other on-demand PCF products by encrypting the data of the
products with access control, allowing security administrators to manage and monitor the instances through the console of the Vormetric Data Security Manager.


## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

The Vormetric Transparent Encryption for PCF tile in its core is a BOSH addon protecting a product instance.  Working
together with the BOSH addon is a Registration Service that supports multi-tenancy by generating registration data based
on the tile configuration that maps organizations and spaces to Vormetric domains. In other words, product instances owned
by one organization and space are protected by VTE agents managed by the corresponding domain according to the mapping rule
in the tile configuration. The tile registers with a Vormetric Data Security Manager and protects directories based on the
pre-configured encryption keys and policies for the specific products.

The Vormetric Transparent Encryption for PCF currently supports the following PCF products:

* PCF MySQL v2.4.0 or later
