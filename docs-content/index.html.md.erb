This documentation describes the Vormetric Transparent Encryption (VTE) tile for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). The Vormetric
Transparent Encryption for PCF tile works in conjunction with other on-demand PCF products by encrypting the data of the
products with access control, allowing security administrators to manage and monitor the instances through the console of the Vormetric Data Security Manager.


## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Vormetric Transparent Encryption (VTE) for PCF protects data stored within PCF products with file-level encryption and
access control, effectively limiting data file access to only allowed users, groups, and processes.  This combination enables
organizations to meet compliance requirements and best practices for data security, including access control for
administrators of the Pivotal environment.

The solution is a BOSH addon and supports multi-tenancy.  A Registration Service maps tenant organizations and spaces as
defined in Pivotal Apps Manager to domains within a Vormetric data security management environment.  Once registered,
the Vormetic tile protects directories based on pre-configured encryption keys and policies.  Domains within this
management environment can isolate management of data security policies and keys for specific PCF instances to specific
organizations or business units.

A Vormetric Data Security Manager (DSM) is required to run the VTE tile.

The Vormetric Transparent Encryption for PCF currently supports the following PCF products:

* PCF MySQL v2.4.0 or above
