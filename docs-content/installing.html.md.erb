##<a id='appendix-b'></a>Configuring Vormetric Data Security Manager

1. A System Security administrator creates a domain that maps to a Pivotal Organization Space created by a PCF
operator based on the tile configuration and the naming convention in **Translating Pivotal Organization Space to Vormetric Domain**.

2. The System administrator creates a Domain administrator for the domain created in Step 1.

3. The Domain administrator creates a Domain Security administrator with all privileges. For more separation of duty
using different administrators privileges, refer to the Administrator Guide.

4. The Domain Security administrator creates key, policy, and host group with host settings, shared secret, and
guard path for the domain observing the naming convention in **Translating Pivotal Organization Space to Vormetric Domain**.
The shared secret for the host group must be the same for all host groups across all domains.
